22.07 finish with new loggers and start dependency injection

handlers.go function home() is still writing errors in standart logger GO
working on it, have to change this to errorLog logger
update home() and other handler functions in handler.go
made mistake in file type "./ui/html/home.page.tmpl:" "changed to .bak" for testing new logger, tested - OK
